# Git Basics

## Question 1: What Is Git?
Git is a distributed-version control system (VCS) that allows developers to track changes to code over time. It's like a powerful snapshot tool for your projects, enabling you to:

- **Track Changes**: Record every modification made to your code base, making it easy to see who changed what and when.
- **Branching and Merging**: Create separate branches to work on different features simultaneously, then merge them back into the main codebase seamlessly.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project concurrently, with Git managing and merging their contributions efficiently.
- **Versioning**: Revert back to previous versions of your code if needed, offering a safety net for experimentation and bug fixes.
- **Open Source**: Git is free and open-source software, widely used and supported by a large community of developers.

## Question 2: What is Centralized-Version Control System and Distributed-Version Control System?
Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS) and Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) are two ways to manage and track changes to software development projects. The main difference is where the files are stored:

### CVCS
- Stores all files in a central repository.
- Developers commit their changes to this central copy.

### DVCS
- Stores files across multiple repositories.
- Each developer has a complete copy of the project on their computer, including the full history.

## Question 3: What is Fork?
A fork is your own copy of another user's repository. It lives on your GitHub account (or wherever you host your Git repositories) and is entirely independent of the original repository.
